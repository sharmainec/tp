# LingoGO!
- LingoGO! is for university students who use English as their first language and are trying to learn a new language. It provides a fast way to generate flashcards so that students can memorise words faster.
- This is our [deployed project documentation](https://ay2122s1-cs2103t-t11-2.github.io/tp/).

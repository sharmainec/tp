## Tutorial

Upon completing the [Quick start](#quick-start) guide, your LingoGO! should look like this:
![Ui](images/Ui.png)

Now, it is time for a quick tutorial to run through the features of LingoGO!. Follow a long for a tour of how to use the app!

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Creating your flashcards
Let's start off our tutorial by creating some new flashcards!

1. First, let's add a new French phrase "Bonjour", which translates to "hello" in English. Simply type in `add e/hello f/Bonjour l/French` into the command box, as can be seen below:
   ![enterAddCommand](images/enterAddCommandTutorial.png)

    <div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

2. Now press the Enter key and voila! A new flashcard has been created and added to the bottom of the list, as can be seen below:
   ![addTutorial](images/addTutorial.png)

3. Now trying adding another French phrase on your own! How about "Au Revoir" which means "Good Bye" in English.
   
   Done? Good job! Your app should now look like this:
   ![addAuRevoir](images/addAuRevoirTutorial.png)
   
   <div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

    **:information_source: Made a mistake?**<br>
    
    * You can always use the [`delete`](#deleting-a-flashcard-delete) or [`edit`](#editing-a-flashcard-edit) commands to make corrections to your flashcards.
    
    </div>

### Searching and selecting your flashcards

Before we can start practicing with the flashcards we have created, we must first select them using [`list`](#listing-flashcards-list), [`filter`](#filtering-flashcards-by-conditions-filter),
or [`find`](#locating-flashcards-by-keywords-find) commands. These commands also act as search commands for LingoGO!, 
allowing you to find the flashcards you need quickly.

1. Let's select all your French flashcards with the [`filter`](#filtering-flashcards-by-conditions-filter) command. Type in `filter l/French` into the command box.
2. Upon pressing Enter, you will get a filtered list of flashcards. Notice how only your French language flashcards are displayed:
   ![filteredFlashcardsTutorial.png](images/filteredFlashcardsTutorial.png)

    <div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Practicing with your flashcards
Once we have selected all the French flashcards, we can finally start our practice session using LingoGO!'s [Slideshow mode](#slideshow-mode).

1. To begin you practice session, simply type [`slideshow`](#entering-slideshow-mode-slideshow) into the command box and press Enter. You will now enter LingoGO!'s [Slideshow mode](#slideshow-mode) where you will see a maximized view of a flashcard with only its foreign phrase.
   ![slideshowTutorial.png](images/slideshowTutorial.png)

    <div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

2. To give an answer for "Bonjour", enter `answer e/Hello` into the command box. You will then see the message below:
   ![answerTutorial.png](images/answerTutorial.png)

    <div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

   **:information_source: Just a little hint**<br>

    * Answers are **not** case-sensitive, which is why "Hello" matches "hello".

    </div>

3. To go to the next flashcard, enter `next` into the command box. Can you also provide the answer for this next flashcard shown? If you got the answer right, then well done! At this point, you may also enter `previous` into the command box to go back to the previous flashcard.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Sharing your flashcards
Now that you are done practicing with all your French flashcards, it is time to share them with your friends to let them try it out!

1. Before you do this, you first need to enter [`stop`](#exiting-slideshow-mode-stop) into the command box to exit [Slideshow mode](#slideshow-mode) and go back to [List mode](#list-mode).
2. Now to export your flashcards, simply enter `export myCards.csv` into the command box. You will then see the message as shown below:
   ![exportTutorial.png](images/exportTutorial.png)
    <div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

3. Your flashcards have been exported into a [CSV](#csv) file named *myCards.csv* located in the *data folder* of your app's *[home folder](#home-folder)*.
   You may then send these files to your friends via email or other means. They can then import this file into their own LingoGO! app via the 
   [`import`](#importing-flashcards-import) command. Below is what *myCards.csv* looks like in Microsoft Excel:
   ![csvTutorial.png](images/csvTutorial.png)

With that, we are finally done with our tutorial! Do also check out [General commands](#general-commands), [List mode commands](#list-mode-commands) and [Slideshow mode commands](#slideshow-mode-commands) sections below for a full list of commands and their details.

<hr/>

## Modes

Before diving into the specific commands, let's have an overview of the different modes in LingoGO!.

LingoGO! has two main modes, [List mode](#list-mode) and [Slideshow mode](#slideshow-mode), through which you can interact with
the application. List mode provides an intuitive **table overview** to **manage flashcards** with our
powerful and flexible search features. In contrast, Slideshow mode allows you to **test your knowledge** on selected
flashcards one by one in a **questionnaire-style interface** while retaining the look and feel of traditional flashcards.

The following two sections will describe these modes in further detail.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### List mode

Below is an example of what LingoGO! looks like in List mode.

![Ui](images/Ui.png)

LingoGO! always starts in List mode and displays all of your flashcards.

List mode lets you [`add`](#adding-a-flashcard-add), [`delete`](#deleting-a-flashcard-delete),
[`edit`](#editing-a-flashcard-edit), [`import`](#importing-flashcards-import), and [`export`](#exporting-flashcards-export)
flashcards.

Sometimes, you may also want to search for specific flashcards among all your saved flashcards. List mode allows you to 
do this easily using the [`list`](#listing-flashcards-list), [`filter`](#filtering-flashcards-by-conditions-filter),
and [`find`](#locating-flashcards-by-keywords-find) commands.

The [`list`](#listing-flashcards-list), [`filter`](#filtering-flashcards-by-conditions-filter),
and [`find`](#locating-flashcards-by-keywords-find) commands also serve as the means to select which flashcards to 
display. This is useful for your practice sessions as the displayed flashcards will be the 
flashcards you get tested on when you switch to [Slideshow mode](#slideshow-mode).
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Slideshow mode

Below is an example of what LingoGO! looks like in Slideshow mode.

![Slideshow](images/Slideshow.png)

Once you have selected your flashcards using the [`list`](#listing-flashcards-list), [`filter`](#filtering-flashcards-by-conditions-filter), or
[`find`](#locating-flashcards-by-keywords-find) commands in [List mode](#list-mode), you may proceed to test your 
knowledge with them by entering Slideshow mode.

Slideshow mode brings the most out of your practice session by allowing you to focus on one
flashcard at a time. The foreign phrase of each flashcard is shown, and you must key in the English translation to test your memory.

To enter Slideshow mode, use the [`slideshow`](#entering-slideshow-mode-slideshow) command. 

In Slideshow mode, you can:
* Move to [`next`](#moving-to-the-next-flashcard-in-slideshow-mode-next) or
  [`previous`](#moving-to-the-previous-flashcard-in-slideshow-mode-previous) flashcards.
* Enter an [`answer`](#answering-a-flashcard-answer) for a flashcard.

Once you are done practicing, you may exit Slideshow mode using the [`stop`](#exiting-slideshow-mode-stop) command.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: A note about Slideshow mode:**<br>

* If your flashcards have phrases that are too long to be displayed, you can **increase the app's window size**.

</div>

<hr/>

## Command format
This section aims to provide you with a quick breakdown of LingoGO!'s command format.


### Command Words

  * Each command always starts with a command word such as `add` or `find`.
  * Command words are case-sensitive (e.g. `clEar` will not be accepted for the `clear` command).
  * Along with command words, commands may come with extra details that need to be filled up (e.g. `clear` is an example of a command used with just the command word alone while`add l/LANGUAGE e/ENGLISH_PHRASE f/FOREIGN_PHRASE` is an example of a command that comes with details 
      that need to be provided by you).

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Prefixes

  * Certain prefixes have been reserved for use by LingoGO!'s commands. Prefixes are used by LingoGO! to identify your inputs (e.g. LingoGO! will interpret `l/Tamil` as a language called `Tamil`).
  * All command prefixes and the inputs they identify are as listed below:

    Prefix | Identification type
    --------|----------
    `e/` | English phrase
    `f/` | Foreign phrase
    `i/` | Index/Indices
    `l/` | Language
    `r/` | Index range
    
  * Prefixes are case-sensitive (e.g. `E/` will not be accepted for `e/`).
  * If there are repeated prefixes in a command, only the last occurrence will be taken (e.g. `edit 2 e/Hi e/Hello` is the same as `edit 2 e/Hello`).
  * Prefixes (along with their respective parameters) can be given in any order (e.g. if the command specifies `add l/LANGUAGE e/ENGLISH_PHRASE f/FOREIGN_PHRASE`, `add f/FOREIGN_PHRASE l/LANGUAGE e/ENGLISH_PHRASE` is also acceptable).

### Parameters

  * Words in `UPPER_CASE` are parameters to be supplied by you (e.g. a usage of `add l/LANGUAGE e/ENGLISH_PHRASE f/FOREIGN_PHRASE` could be `add l/Chinese e/Good Morning f/早安`).
  * Some commands have optional parameters which you do not need to give. These optional parameters are 
    indicated within square brackets (e.g. `edit INDEX [l/LANGUAGE] [e/ENGLISH_PHRASE] [f/FOREIGN_PHRASE]` can be used as `edit 1 l/Chinese e/Good Morning f/早安` or `edit 1 e/Good Morning`).
  * Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters will be ignored (e.g. `help 123` is the same as `help`).
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

<hr/>

## Flashcard format
When you add or edit a flashcard, you have to give one or more of the following three parameters: `LANGUAGE`, `ENGLISH_PHRASE`, `FOREIGN_PHRASE`.
These parameters follow strict formatting to allow LingoGO!'s commands to run correctly. This section thus aims to explain the details of these
formats below.

### `LANGUAGE` parameter
  * Should not be longer than **50 characters**.
  * Should only contain **alphabetic** characters (e.g. "华文" will not be accepted, since it is not alphabetic).
  * The first letter of each word will be capitalized and the remaining letters will be in lowercase (e.g. "behasa 
    mElayu" will be saved as "Behasa Melayu").

### `ENGLISH_PHRASE` parameter
  * Should not be longer than **100 characters**.
  * Is not restricted to alphabetic characters only, but it is **recommended** that you ensure your input is a valid English input (e.g. you can use "こんにちは" as an English input).

### `FOREIGN_PHRASE` parameter
  * Should not be longer than **100 characters**.
  * [Slideshow mode](#slideshow-mode) will **only** display the `FOREIGN_PHRASE` of a flashcard. To use the [`answer`](#answering-a-flashcard-answer) command correctly, you need to be able to distinguish between flashcards with the same `FOREIGN_PHRASE`
  but different `ENGLISH_PHRASE`.
<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: A note about flashcards:**<br>

* LingoGO! **does not allow** you to have **duplicate flashcards** (duplicate flashcards are flashcards containing the same `LANGUAGE`, `ENGLISH_PHRASE`, and `FOREIGN_PHRASE`).

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Locating flashcards by keyword(s): `find`

Finds flashcards from the **entire** app based on the keyword(s) specified.

Format: `find [e/ENGLISH_KEYWORDS] [f/FOREIGN_KEYWORDS]`

* The search for english keywords is **not case-sensitive**, e.g "HELLO" will match "Hello".
* The search for foreign keywords is **case-sensitive** because some language depends on capitalization rules, e.g. in German, "Morgen" translates to "morning" but "morgen" translates to "tomorrow".
* The **order** of the keywords **does not matter**, e.g. "Good morning" will match "Morning good".
* Only **full words** will be matched for **English keywords**, e.g. "Fire" will **not** match "Fireworks".
* **Non-full words** match will be accepted for **foreign keywords**, e.g. "早" with match "早安".
* Flashcard(s) **matching at least one keyword** will be displayed.
* **At least one** of the optional fields must be provided.

Examples:

![find example list](images/FindExample.png)

For each example below, refer to the snapshot above as the starting point before the command is executed.
* `find e/HELLO` returns all flashcards in the app that matches the English keyword "Hello" in the displayed flashcard list in [List mode](#list-mode), e.g. only flashcard #1 will be displayed in the displayed flashcard list.

(instead of replacing the current list).

Format: `import CSV_FILE_NAME`

Below is an example of how the [CSV](#csv) file might look like.
![sample CSV file](images/SampleCSVFile.png)

* Place the [CSV](#csv) file that you wish to import in the *data folder*
 (located in the same folder as the *lingogo.jar* file).
* The [CSV](#csv) file must have **3 column headers** in this order from left to right (refer to sample [CSV](#csv) file above):
  1. Language
  2. Foreign
  3. English

## Slideshow mode commands

The following section gives an in-depth overview of all [Slideshow mode](#list-mode) commands in LingoGO!. As such, commands in this section can only be run in [Slideshow mode](#slideshow-mode). If you are a new user, you may also want to refer to the [Command format](#command-format) and
[Flashcard format](#flashcard-format) sections above for a breakdown of LingoGO!'s command and flashcard formats.


### Answering a flashcard: `answer`

Checks whether the answer you have provided correctly translates to the foreign phrase displayed in [Slideshow mode](#slideshow-mode).

Format: `answer e/ENGLISH_PHRASE`

* Checks the English phrase of the displayed foreign phrase in [Slideshow mode](#slideshow-mode) against the `ENGLISH_PHRASE` you provide.
* The app will then show the correct English phrase and tell you whether you got it right.
* `ENGLISH_PHRASE` is not case-sensitive (e.g. "HeLLo" matches "hello").
* During a slideshow, you can only answer each flashcard once.

Examples:
